# WorkoutApp

My very first take on creating some form of application to help with creating/tracking workouts. Even though it never got to a completed state I learned a lot from this project.
The biggest being how much work and effort it takes to execute an idea correctly. Looking back, I was a bit too ambitious with this and tried to commit to more than I should have.
